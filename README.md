# Minimal Vintage Clothing E-Commerce Site with Payments

üõí A minimalist vintage clothing e-commerce site built using Next.js, Stripe, and Supabase.

## üîç Overview

This app provides all the essential features of a modern e-commerce site, including user authentication, product browsing, wishlist registration, cart management, and secure checkout. Payments are handled via Stripe, and purchase data is automatically saved through Webhook integration with Supabase.

> üìå **Note:** The current version uses demo product data and Stripe is operating in test mode.  
> üõçÔ∏è I plan to add real product listings and switch to live payment mode in the near future.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Database & Auth)
- Stripe (Payment processing)
- Prisma (ORM)
- Contentful (Headless CMS for product data)

## ‚ú® Features

- User authentication (Sign up / Log in)
- Product list and detail pages
- Cart functionality (supports both logged-in and guest users)
- Wishlist functionality
- Purchase history view for logged-in users
- Stripe Checkout integration
- Thank you page after successful payment
- Automatic saving of purchase history via Webhook

## üß† Notable Highlights

- **Complete logic separation based on login state**  
  Key features like cart, wishlist, and purchase history behave differently depending on the user's login state:
  - For guest users, data is managed using `useState` and stored in `localStorage`
  - For logged-in users, data is saved in Supabase and tied to their unique user ID

- **Checkout metadata integration with Stripe**  
  User IDs and product data are passed via Stripe Checkout metadata and handled through Webhooks to securely and automatically save order history to Supabase.

- **Product management with Contentful**  
  Products are managed through a headless CMS (Contentful), enabling non-developers to update product information without touching the codebase.
